1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
The five objects created are three dog objects, an array list of those  dogs, and the Comparator method that is comparing dogs. 

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?

The Comparator constructor call is in main in the MyCompare3 class where @Override is written.  The class definition for the Comparator is a part of the Animal class since it is "Comparator<Animal>" and the method you are using is public int compareand you are comparing Animal 1 to Animal 2.
